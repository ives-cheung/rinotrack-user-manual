## 🚀 Quick Start Path

1️⃣ Start with **[System Hardware Components](01-hardware.md)** to understand the overall equipment  
2️⃣ Then learn **[the Main Interface](02-interface.md)** to become familiar with operations  
3️⃣ Configure **[Communication Settings](03-communication.md)** to connect signals  
4️⃣ Create **[your first job](05-create-job.md)**  
5️⃣ Finally **[start autonomous driving](06-navigation.md)** and get to work  

## 💡 Tips

- Different agricultural machinery models may have different hardware configurations; contact your dealer if you have questions
- When system parameters display normally, no adjustments are needed; the system will handle operations automatically
- Demo mode is suitable for learning operations indoors or in environments without signals
