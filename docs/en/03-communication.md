## 3.1 Differential Signal Access Methods

The system supports multiple differential GNSS signal access methods:

### 3.1.1 Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) Positioning
- Accuracy: ±2-3 centimeters
- Suitable for high-precision operations
- Requires a base station or differential signal source

### 3.1.2 DGPS Method
- Accuracy: ±0.5-1 meter
- Wide coverage area
- Relatively low cost

### 3.1.3 Network Differential (NTRIP)
- Receives differential data via 4G/Wi-Fi
- No need to establish a base station
- Suitable for mobile operations

## 3.2 Configuration Steps

1. Go to **Settings** → **Communication Configuration**
2. Select your desired differential signal access method
3. Enter base station information or account credentials
4. Click **Connect** to test
5. Confirm signal strength displays normally and save
